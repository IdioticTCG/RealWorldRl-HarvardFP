### Reinforcement Learning is a subset of A.I. that learns from its mistakes. It's currently the most developed and researched type of A.I.
### Its uses span from playing game to medical purposes. For my project I opted to use this A.I. Normally, it's used for purely digial purposes, but I wanted to use this technology in the real world.
