# Real World Reinforcement Learning
## Video Demo:
## Description:
#### Reinforcement Learning is a subset of A.I. that learns from its mistakes. It's currently the most developed and researched type of A.I. Its uses span from playing games to medical purposes. For my project, I opted to use this A.I. Normally, it's used for purely digial purposes, but I wanted to use this technology in the real world. I created a program in python with reinforcement learning to find the shorest path from a point to a different point. I paired this with a Raspberry Pi so I could a move a servo motor. I hooked up a laser pointer to the motor, and I created a target with boxes representing the points in the program. Next, I added a function to move the servo every time the A.I. finds the next point in the path. This will allow me to incorporate reinforcement learning into the real world.
